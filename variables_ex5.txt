In the first program, x prints 3.
The second gets an error because x is undefined. 
This is because x is defined in the outer block in the first
example and in the inner block in the second and is displayed
in the outer block in both instances. Outer block variables 
are seen in the inner block but inner block variables are  
not seen in the outer block.
